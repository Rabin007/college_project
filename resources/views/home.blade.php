	<h1> ABOUT US </h1>
	<p> I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the

    American fashion. I gave her freedom, but -- I taught her never to dishonor her family. She

    found a boyfriend; not an Italian. She went to the movies with him; she stayed out late. I

    didn't protest. Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made

    her drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her

    honor. So they beat her, like an animal. When I went to the hospital, her nose was a'broken.

    Her jaw was a'shattered, held together by wire. She couldn't even weep because of the pain.

    But I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life -- beautiful girl. Now she will

    never be beautiful again. 
	</p>
	<p> I -- I went to the police, like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The

    judge sentenced them to three years in prison -- suspended sentence. Suspended sentence!

    They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastard,

    they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, "for justice, we must go to Don Corleone."
	</p>
	<p> We've known each other many years, but this is the first time you came to me for counsel,

    for help. I can't remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of

    coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here: you

    never wanted my friendship. And uh, you were afraid to be in my debt. I understand. You found paradise in America, had a good trade, made a good living. The

    police protected you; and there were courts of law. And you didn't need a friend of me. But

    uh, now you come to me and you say -- "Don Corleone give me justice." -- But you don't ask

    with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. Instead,

    you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you uh ask me to do

    murder, for money.
